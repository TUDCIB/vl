This feature project needs the gemini-blueprint-publishedRepository created archive with all required 3rd party bundles.
Therefore it needs a target platform where all bundles are available so that a new target platform based on this feature configuration
can be created. This needed target platform usually is the localtarget.target in the core-target project.
